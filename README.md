# GeneticAlgortihm
Implemented a genetic algorithm for cryptanalysis using Python for the COSC 3P71 course.

To run the code,

Firstly ensure you have the required dependencies which are matplotlib, and numpy.

Secondly, Run the code and change up the parameters as required. 

The different parameters that can be changed are given at the top of the code and the result should print out the fitness for each generation, and plot the results as a graph. 

The user picks the crossover method that they need to implement, and the results will vary based on the selection. If any issues are encountered, please email me for any further questions and I can help in running the code.
